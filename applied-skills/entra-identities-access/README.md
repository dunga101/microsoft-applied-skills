## Assessment Overview

This Applied Skills assessment evaluated hands-on identity and access management operations within Microsoft Entra ID.  
The focus was on understanding how Conditional Access policies are evaluated during authentication and how risk-based signals influence access decisions.

The assessment environment simulated real-world enterprise scenarios involving user sign-ins, device platforms, network locations, and identity risk.

## Assessment Objectives

- Evaluate Conditional Access policy behavior under different sign-in conditions
- Use What If analysis to determine policy applicability and order of evaluation
- Understand the impact of report-only versus enforced policies
- Configure and validate named locations for access control logic
- Review authentication methods, MFA, and Self-Service Password Reset configuration
- Interpret sign-in risk signals and their effect on access decisions
